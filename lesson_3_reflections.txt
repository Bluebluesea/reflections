When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when I want to share my work with people or I want others to work with me on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    sometimes you may not want to use the commit made by somebody.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks is you copy someone elses' work and make it your own repository on Github. when you can't or don't want to change the original version.
    clones is you copy a repository on Github to your own local computer. when you want to change and modify files on your local computer.
    branches is when you want to add or experiment some new features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    so you can keep your local up-to-date and sync with the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    maybe we'd use a share folder, we upload our version each time when we finish it. Github would be a lot easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    the author needs to check if the change is valid or if she/he wants the change, so you'd better make changes in a separate branch.
    to have a separate branch won't break the main feature.
